# add more details about what are project is here
The Justice League WOW Project was birthed in the spirit of community first thinking and easy access to information. We want communities to be able to research what type of officers are patroling their communites. Is the officer a community partner or gestapo. The project will develop and have information on the Neighborhood Coordination Officers(NCOs) that are assigned to a neighborhood to serve as liasisons between the police and the community. in further development stages the app will also have the command structure and contact information for the local precincts.


You can search in the search bar an officer's last name or badge # to find results.
If you don't know how to spell the exact name of an officer. You can type any combination of letters in the search box and it will pull back a list of officers that have those sequence of letters in their last name.
